0. Come up with good node-level features
    Topological Measures
        Distance
            Hopcount/Distance (min jumps from node to node)
            Closeness (average hopcount to all nodes)
            Eccentricity (the longest hopcount to any node)
            Betweenness (number of shortest paths that traverse the node)
        Connection
            Degree
            Local clustering coefficient (cliquishness of a node's neighbors)
1. Implement node-level features

2. Come up with network-level features
3. Implement network-level features

4. Implement random graph generator
5. Normalize network statistics vs average random graph
6. Normalize node
