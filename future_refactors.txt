0. refactor project, play, and scene to be type-safe
1. clean up the pass-object-or-pass-title logic
2. lift common logic (repr, etc) into superclass
3. allow classes to be instantiated with their characters/scenes/plays, where possible
4. add functional tests to project, play, and scene
5. remove duplicate fixtures from test files -> refactor into imports
6. Fix the __repr__ functions -> eval(repr(object)) == object
7. Add test cases to play_parser
